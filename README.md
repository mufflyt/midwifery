# midwifery

Scraper for the [AMCB certification directory](https://ams.amcbmidwife.org/amcbssa/f?p=AMCBSSA:17800)
(American Midwifery Certification Board public primary-source verification listing).

## Usage

    python3 scrape.py    # writes midwives.csv

No dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

## How it works

The directory is an Oracle APEX classic report that hard-caps any result set at
500 rows — paging past row 500 returns *"Invalid set of rows requested"*. The
per-discipline `Total : N` line, however, is exact even when the rows are
capped.

Only four search items are honoured by the report: certification, certification
number, last name and first name. Certification number matches by `INSTR`
(substring, no wildcards), which gives the partition used here:

* numbers prefixed `CNM`/`CM` — walk the prefix digit by digit; the prefix only
  occurs at the start, so a prefixed pattern is effectively anchored
* bare digit numbers — sweep every 3-digit substring, since any number with at
  least three digits contains one. The 2- and 1-digit sweeps run only if the
  running count still falls short

Each bucket under the cap is fetched in a single 500-row request and
de-duplicated on (certification, certification number). The scraper checks its
result against the reported total before writing.

Collected 2026-08-06: 22,309 records (183 Certified Midwives, 22,126 Certified
Nurse-Midwives), matching the directory's own totals exactly.

## Output columns

`certification, certification_number, status, certification_date,
expiration_date, last_name, first_name, middle_name, discipline, primary_source`
