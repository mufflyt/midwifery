# =============================================================================
# The mutation catalogue: plausible bugs, and the tests that must catch them
# =============================================================================
# Every other suite in tests/ asks "is the code right?". This one asks "would we
# notice if it were wrong?", which is a different question and the only one that
# measures the suite itself.
#
# Each entry is a bug a competent person could actually introduce -- an
# inverted operator, a loosened threshold, a disabled guard -- paired with the
# tests that ought to turn red. A mutation that SURVIVES is not a bug in the
# code; it is a hole in the tests, and it is reported as one.
#
# Rules for adding an entry:
#
#   * `find` must occur EXACTLY ONCE in `file`. The runner fails if it occurs
#     zero times (the mutation has rotted and is silently testing nothing) or
#     more than once (it would mutate more than intended). A catalogue that
#     quietly stops applying is worse than no catalogue.
#   * `killers` names the specific tests that SHOULD detect it. Listing the
#     whole suite would make every mutation look caught for the wrong reason
#     and would take an hour.
#   * `why` states the real-world failure. If you cannot write that sentence,
#     the mutation is probably not plausible enough to be worth a slot.
#
# NOTE ON SCOPE. These mutate helper/contract code, not the numbered pipeline
# scripts. Pipeline scripts need person-level inputs that are absent on a
# runner, so mutating them would produce "survived" for want of data rather
# than for want of a test -- a false hole, which is worse than a missed one.
